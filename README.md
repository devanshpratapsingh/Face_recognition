# Face_recognition

This is a simple programme that uses OpenCV and already traines haarcascade model for eye and face detection.

Till now I've reached to the point where my model can "detect" a face and eyes in it!

I've used an input video here but for a realtime experience, all you need to do is put 0 or whatever camera you want to give input to in line 6 in place of "testvid.mp4" 

This is how it looks...
